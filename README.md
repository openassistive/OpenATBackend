OpenATBackend
================

[Swagger API Documentation](http://api.openassistive.org/docs/v1/#!/default/saveProject)


Open Assistive (Technology) - What is it? 
============================
Its a site to collate all Open source Hardware and Software projects from around the web that aim to help someone with disabilities (i.e. Assistive Technology).
The site (will be) a static site hosted by GitHub pages. Its dynamically generated by http://gohugo.io. The full site can be found at https://github.com/openassistive/OpenATFrontEnd

On the site a user can add a new project by adding a project from say Thingiverse, Sourceforge, Github or others. This API is then called that scrapes the site for the important meta-data and with "save" can then save the data to the GitHub repo for the front-end. Travis will then rebuild the site (or project maintainers will manually build the site daily).

Why this way? Well because we want to create a sustainable, low-cost and easy to manage system. We think this is one of the easiest - and most reliable "stacks" to do this! Its a bit of an experiment

Details
=======

OpenATBackend is a node server that has 2 API routes. For details [see the documentation here](http://api.openassistive.org/docs/v1/)

To run
======

You will need some environment variables to make this run. Notably:

* `GitHubOAuth` with your [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). 
* `RecaptchaSecret` with your Google details [here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin) and then apply to the env var..
* `AlgoliaAppID` - from a [Algolia](http://algolia.com) account
* `AlgoliaAPIKey` - from the same [Algolia](http://algolia.com) account
* `OpenATIndexName=OPENAT` - the name of the [Algolia](http://algolia.com) index you are pushing to

and to test simply set this env var:

* TEST_MODE=1

I recommend using [direnv](http://direnv.net) for this task. It makes setting env vars between projects much easier.  Otherwise use a script a bit like this:

		#!/bin/sh

		export GitHubOAuth=<key>
		export RecaptchaSecret=<secret>
		export AlgoliaAppID=<id>
		export AlgoliaAPIKey=<key>
		export OpenATIndexName=OPENAT
		export TEST_MODE=1

e.g. in your terminal:

	git clone https://github.com/openassistive/OpenATBackend.git
	npm install
	node server.js 

then navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the server.
